# SDV-Downgrader

## Windows 10 v1803+ Only.
### Uses tar and curl which were added in that version. If you've updated your Windows 10 at all since April 2018, you're good to go.

A Batch script to automate downloading older versions of Stardew Valley for speedrunning. Just download the .bat file from the releases tab and double click it.

## Known Issues
Sometimes it doesn't download the entire game at once. I currently have a small workaround where it runs the DepotDownloader program twice to validate the files. Not really sure what's causing this, and I can't bugtest anymore tonight since I got ratelimited by the steam login. Will attempt to fix at a later date. 

For now, if it doesn't download fully, rerun the tool and download the same version.
