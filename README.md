# Stardew Valley Downgrader

Stardew Valley Downgrader is a app written in Electron to automate downloading older versions of Stardew Valley for speedrunning using DepotDownloader.

I used [SteamDepotDownloaderGUI by mmvanheusden](https://github.com/mmvanheusden/SteamDepotDownloaderGUI) as a base for this project.
