Todo:
  ☐ Find a way to verify depot download without running DepotDownloader twice.
  ✔ Stop script from downloading all of the versions no matter what version is chosen. Should just be a simple goto fix. @done(21-10-15 12:10)
  ✔ Make header show in main menu (gotta have those aesthetics) @done(21-10-15 12:24)
  ☐ Make downloader work for other games (maybe pull a list of depots from AppID and make it selectable?) Would have to update from CmdMenuSel to GetInput batch plugin for that to work properly.
  ☐ Possibly make this work on all platforms (requires complete port to either Electron or Mono)
